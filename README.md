### Koyango
A small and simple Django app, that I wrote using Python and Django.

It consists of 3 parts - World Time, Calendar and Notes.

# World time 
This shows current time of various timezones that I've selected, namely:

* PDT/PST - West USA
* EDT/EST - East USA
* GMT/UTC - Greenwich Mean Time / Coordinated Universal Time
* CEST/CET - Central Europe
* CST - China
* JST - Japan
* AEST - Australia

# Calendar
This simply shows selected days in selected month of 2024 year. It shows Saturdays in orange color, Sundays in red color and today in blue color.

# Notes
This module lets the user write and store notes, as well as create categories for them. It uses SQLite database engine, which is the default engine used by Django.


# What I used to create this

* Python 3.11.4
* Django 5.0.6
* Django documentation
* Python documentation

# Closing note

I'm sharing this publicly as-is, if you want to/need to use it, go for it. Bear in mind I'm not responsible for whatever damages it may or may not occur.
